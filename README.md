# Additions

Used Brackey's randomizer script as a baseline. My ShapeRandomizer script can randomize the position, scale, and color of the shape it is attached to.

Created buttons in the custom editor to run all of these randomizer functions

Added sliders for private properties on ShapeRandomizer to change the range of the randomization for each property (x, y, z posiitons and scale)

Buttons to reset the properties of the shape itself, and to reset the randomization sliders

I also wanted visiblity on what the randomize functions were setting the shaper's properties to, so I added another button to show/hide the shaper's position, scale, and color in the custom editor
